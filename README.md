# Flaechenland
This is a game created for a school programming project, with a lot of passion, creativity, and... hardcoding. As simple as it is, it is fun to play! Created by Marius Menzel, Milena Czierlinski, Lasse Schmidt and David Schledewitz.

### Known Issues/Ideas (fix if you like)

#### Issues
- Exit handling during the game (window closes now, but process doesnt stop? Good enough for now)
- Display size is static

#### Ideas
- Would be nice to have a collected property class for like cooldown movement speed, enemy lifes and so on, to easily adjust properties
- MORE ROOOOMS, rooms behind rooms, checkpoints, ets
- If a enemy is killed, theres a chance to drop items? speed boost, fire power, lives, invisibility for 5 sec?
- Different enemy classes (green sniper enemies?, heat seakers)
- GAMEMODES: easy, hard, impossible. I.e. with speed variation of the oponents, or tracking oponents?
- different keys? effects? doors to unlock? (colors)
- New action buttons (hook, different weapons, chnging with number keys, JUMPING/short invisibility with right tool)
   - action button to take key (changing color of player, to transit walls of the respective color)
- Alle keys? BOSS LEVEL, ist super gross (wir dn grosser und schneller, je weniger leben er noch hat), mehr leben, lava die den raum von einer seite fuellt (vikas idee)
